# Logic Files

## Quick Start

The source code and self-compiled files are currently experimental. If you want
a known stable ROMY logic. please refer to the two files

 * RomyRev10.zip
 * RomyRev11.zip

## Overview

The jedec/ directory contains the logic files compiled from the source file in
source/.

There are two different revisions of ROMY:

* Revision 10 is the recommended one for A3000 and A4000D.
* Revision 11 might fix issues with the NCR 710 on A4000T

There are also different versions for 1MB and 4MB ROMYs.

## Building

make will compile all 4 combinations of ROMY logic. You will need
WinCUPL installed under wine.
